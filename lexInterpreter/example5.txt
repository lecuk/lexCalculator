// Shows the difference between optimized and unoptimized functions

f(x) = x^2

// !!!!!!! important !!!!!!!!
// this is special format of finding a derivative: d:x
// firstly you write "d:" and after you write name of argument being differentiated and then function with parameters

df(x) = d:x f(x)
